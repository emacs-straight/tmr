* Version 0.3.0 on 2022-05-17

The gist of TMR's May Release is that TMR is Maintained Rigorously---but
enough with The Mostly Recursive acronyms!

+ This is the first version for which we produce a change log.  The
  short story of previous releases: I (Protesilaos) was using and
  developing TMR (pronounced as "timer" or "T-M-R") as part of my
  personal setup for more than a year until I eventually contributed it
  to GNU ELPA.

+ What was once =tmr.el= is now split up into purpose-specific files:
  =tmr.el= (core functionality), =tmr-tabulated.el= (grid view),
  =tmr-sound.el= (audible notifications), and =tmr-notification.el=
  (desktop notifications).

+ The ~tmr-with-description~ command creates a new timer while always
  asking for a description.  Whereas the standard ~tmr~ command prompts
  for a description only when invoked with a prefix argument.

+ The ~tmr-clone~ command copies the duration and optional description
  of an existing timer object into a new one.  The operation is
  performed without further questions, except if a prefix argument is
  supplied: in that case the command will prompt for a duration and, if
  the original timer had a description, for one as well.  The default
  values of these prompts are those of the original timer.

+ The ~tmr-remove-finished~ deletes all elapsed timers.  This means that
  they are removed from the list of available timers and, thus, cannot
  be cloned.

+ The ~tmr-timer-created-functions~, ~tmr-timer-completed-functions~,
  and ~tmr-timer-cancelled-functions~ are hooks which can be used to
  control what happens once a timer is (i) created, (ii) elapses, or
  (iii) is cancelled.

+ Elapsed and running timers are displayed in a grid view with the
  command ~tmr-tabulated-view~.  The buffer looks like this:

  #+begin_example
  Start      End        Finished?  Description
  09:22:43   09:32:43   âœ”         Prepare tea
  09:17:14   09:37:14              Boil water
  09:07:03   09:57:03              Bake bread
  #+end_example

+ In that grid view, it is possible to create a new timer, or operate on
  the one at point to cancel, clone, redescribe, and reschedule it.

+ Thanks to Christian Tietze for implementing changes to how desktop
  notifications are handled.  The overall effect should still be the
  same for existing users, though the implementation has been redesigned.

+ Thanks to Damien Cassou who is now is my co-author due to multiple
  contributions for =tmr.el=, the addition of the grid view, and the
  splitting of TMR into numerous files.  Please consult the Git commit
  log for the details.  (I still am the maintainer.)
