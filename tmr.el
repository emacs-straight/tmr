;;; Commentary:
;;
;; TMR is an Emacs package that provides facilities for setting timers
;; using a convenient notation.  The point of entry is the `tmr' command.
;; It prompts for a unit of time, which is represented as a string that
;; consists of a number and, optionally, a single character suffix which
;; specifies the unit of time.  Valid input formats:
;;
;; | Input | Meaning   |
;; |-------+-----------|
;; | 5     | 5 minutes |
;; | 5m    | 5 minutes |
;; | 5s    | 5 seconds |
;; | 5h    | 5 hours   |
;;
;; If `tmr' is called with an optional prefix argument (`C-u'), it also
;; asks for a description which accompanies the given timer.  Preconfigured
;; candidates are specified in the user option `tmr-descriptions-list',
;; though any arbitrary input is acceptable at the minibuffer prompt.
;;
;; An alternative to the `tmr' command is `tmr-with-description'.  The
;; difference between the two is that the latter always prompts for a
;; description.
;;
;; When the timer is set, a message is sent to the echo area recording the
;; current time and the point in the future when the timer elapses.  Echo
;; area messages can be reviewed with the `view-echo-area-messages' which is
;; bound to =C-h e= by default.  Though TMR provides its own buffer for
;; reviewing its log: it is named =*tmr-messages*= and can be accessed with
;; the command `tmr-view-echo-area-messages'.
;;
;; Once the timer runs its course, it produces a desktop notification and
;; plays an alarm sound.  The notification's message is practically the
;; same as that which is sent to the echo area.  The sound file for the
;; alarm is defined in `tmr-sound-file', while the urgency of the
;; notification can be set through the `tmr-notification-urgency' option.
;; Note that it is up to the desktop environment or notification daemon to
;; decide how to handle the urgency value.
;;
;; If the `tmr-sound-file' is nil, or the file is not found, no sound will
;; be played.
;;
;; The `tmr-cancel' command is used to cancel running timers (as set by the
;; `tmr' command).  If there is only one timer, it cancels it outright.  If
;; there are multiple timers, it produces a minibuffer completion prompt
;; which asks for one among them.  Timers at the completion prompt are
;; described by the exact time they were set and the input that was used to
;; create them, including the optional description that `tmr' accepts.
